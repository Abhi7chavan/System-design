# High Availability (HA) in System Design

## Definition

High Availability ensures a service or product runs continuously without failure for a given time. It is measured in  **nines (99.9%, 99.99%, etc.)** , where more nines indicate  **higher uptime and lower downtime** :

* **99%** → ~3 days of downtime per year
* **99.9%** → ~8 hours of downtime per year
* **99.99%** → ~52 minutes of downtime per year
* **99.999%** → ~5 minutes of downtime per year
* **99.9999%** → ~30 seconds of downtime per year

## Key Components to Achieve High Availability

### 1. Redundancy

Redundancy ensures backup components are available to take over when the primary component fails. Types include:

#### **1.1 Server Redundancy**

* Deploy the application on multiple servers.
* If a primary server crashes, another server takes over, ensuring no downtime.

#### **1.2 Database Replication**

* Maintain replica databases.
* If one database fails, another replica continues handling requests.

#### **1.3 Geographical Redundancy**

* Distribute resources across multiple locations (regions, availability zones).
* Protects against regional failures or data center outages.

### 2. Load Balancing

Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability. Types include:

#### **2.1 Hardware Load Balancer**

* Physical devices that distribute traffic based on pre-configured rules.
* Example: **F5 Networks, Citrix ADC.**

#### **2.2 Software Load Balancer**

* Uses software solutions to balance traffic dynamically.
* Example: **Nginx, AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), HAProxy.**

### 3. Failure Mechanisms

These mechanisms help the system recover automatically in case of failure:

#### **3.1 Active-Passive Failover**

* Only one primary system is active. If it fails, a backup system takes over.

#### **3.2 Active-Active Failover**

* All components are active and share the load.
* If one fails, the remaining components handle the traffic without interruption.

### 4. Monitoring, Health Checks, and Logging

To maintain high availability, continuous monitoring, logging, and alerting are essential.

#### **4.1 Use Elasticsearch for Logging & Health Checks**

* **Elasticsearch** stores logs and error data efficiently for real-time analysis.
* **Heartbeat** monitors uptime and response times of services.
* **Metricbeat** collects system and service metrics for performance analysis.
* **Elasticsearch Plugins** enhance monitoring and alerting capabilities.
* **Kibana** provides real-time dashboards for visualization and log analysis.

## Best Practices to Achieve High Availability

1. **Design for High Availability**
   * Architect systems with redundancy and failover mechanisms in place.
2. **Daily Health Checks**
   * Continuously monitor system health and detect issues early.
3. **Monitoring & Alerts**
   * Use **Elasticsearch, Heartbeat, and Metricbeat** for proactive monitoring.
   * Set up **real-time alerts** for failures or performance issues.
4. **Use Multiple Availability Zones**
   * Deploy across different zones using **CDN (Content Delivery Network)** to reduce latency and avoid regional outages.
5. **Chaos Engineering**
   * Intentionally introduce failures (Netflix’s  **Chaos Monkey** ) to test system resilience.
6. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   * Detect failures and isolate faulty services to prevent cascading failures.
7. **Smart Caching Strategies**
   * Use caching (Redis, Memcached) to reduce database load and improve response times.
8. **Capacity Planning**
   * Ensure systems can scale up or down based on demand to prevent overload.
